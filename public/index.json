	"content": "Welcome to the AWS Control Design workshop In this session, you will experience the process on identifying, designing and implementing security configurations, detective and preventive guardrails to meet your custom control requirements. You will get hands on a pre-built AWS 3 Tier environment with EC2 Instances and RDS. You will use a main customer scenario and 4 customer exercises to identify their profile and specific service user stories to determine their security control needs. For each scenario you will get to choose the right configuration and control monitoring mechanism for each level. The goal of this workshop is to practice the design and implementation of security configurations and guardrails that meets custom needs beyond AWS Best practices.\nAudience: Security Governance, Risk and Compliance Level: 300 - Advanced - Sessions dive deeper into the selected topic. Presenters assume that the audience has some familiarity with the topic, but may or may not have direct experience implementing a similar solution. Duration 120 min Prerequisites: AWS Account, Admin IAM User/Role. Authors:\nPablo Pagani - Security Practice Manager, ProServe LatAm Miguel Segura - Security Assurance Consultant Andrea Di Fabio - Security Assurance Consultant Issa Basza - Security Assurance Consultant Content Introduction Preparation S3 Server Access Logging "

It plays an essential role in the economy by helping companies in diverse industries make critical decisions with greater confidence. It helps businesses provide a seamless and positive experience during life’s pivotal moments, like applying for a job or mortgage, financing education, or buying a car. Work with over 2.5B+ consumer credit card files and therefore are regulated by multiple entities. This year acquired through merging and acquisitions a company that specializes in preventing fraud risk and loss. This company that has recently merged with them is proprietary of an application named Fraud Risk and Loss application (FRL) that is running in AWS Cloud. Although the FRL app was initially built for minor demand now needs to address corporate control requirements based on NIST 800-53rev5 before releasing into production.\nYou were hired by Voyager as a Cloud Security Architect and your goal is to design and implement the necessary preventive and detective guardrails before it\u0026rsquo;s launched as part of the organization\u0026rsquo;s portfolio.\nYou have the opportunity to learn the process on how to address these issues while leveraging the AWS documentation and security services to design and implement.\n"
