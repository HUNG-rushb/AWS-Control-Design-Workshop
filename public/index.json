	"content": "Welcome to the AWS Control Design workshop In this session, you will experience the process on identifying, designing and implementing security configurations, detective and preventive guardrails to meet your custom control requirements. You will get hands on a pre-built AWS 3 Tier environment with EC2 Instances and RDS. You will use a main customer scenario and 4 customer exercises to identify their profile and specific service user stories to determine their security control needs. For each scenario you will get to choose the right configuration and control monitoring mechanism for each level. The goal of this workshop is to practice the design and implementation of security configurations and guardrails that meets custom needs beyond AWS Best practices.\nAudience: Security Governance, Risk and Compliance Level: 300 - Advanced - Sessions dive deeper into the selected topic. Presenters assume that the audience has some familiarity with the topic, but may or may not have direct experience implementing a similar solution. Duration 120 min Prerequisites: AWS Account, Admin IAM User/Role.

Implement reporting mechanism for patching compliance Exercise Requirements Scenario Voyager Security team has provided the controls and technical requirements to ensure that EC2 Linux instances are patched with only security updates regularly every Saturday after 10:00 pm automatically. Voyager does not have a current solution and is looking to adopt a cloud native approach that can be quickly implemented. Additionally, the Security team is asking for evidence that a detective mechanism is in place to ensure that this requirement is satisfied. You as a Cloud Architect will need to understand the current architecture and determine, based on the EC2 User Guide and AWS Config Manage Rules or conformance packages which options are available to configure a patching solution that meets customer requirements.\nAt AWS Management Console, find S3 and select S3.\nAt S3 console, select Create bucket.\nIn create bucket steps:\nFor AWS Region, select Asia Pacific (Singapore) ap-southeast-1.
