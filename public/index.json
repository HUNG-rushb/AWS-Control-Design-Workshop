	"content": "Welcome to the AWS Control Design workshop In this session, you will experience the process on identifying, designing and implementing security configurations, detective and preventive guardrails to meet your custom control requirements. You will get hands on a pre-built AWS 3 Tier environment with EC2 Instances and RDS. You will use a main customer scenario and 4 customer exercises to identify their profile and specific service user stories to determine their security control needs. For each scenario you will get to choose the right configuration and control monitoring mechanism for each level. The goal of this workshop is to practice the design and implementation of security configurations and guardrails that meets custom needs beyond AWS Best practices.\nAudience: Security Governance, Risk and Compliance Level: 300 - Advanced - Sessions dive deeper into the selected topic. Presenters assume that the audience has some familiarity with the topic, but may or may not have direct experience implementing a similar solution.
