## Security Assurance

### Introduction

**Time to complete**: 25 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:

- Setup Logging at OS Level using Amazon CloudWatch.
- Setup notifications concerning relevant OS events.

### Exercise

#### Requirements Scenario

Voyager Security team has provided the technical requirements to ensure that Operating Systems (OS) logs are captured, and alerts are sent to monitoring and response teams for critical events. For example, root access shall be considered a critical event and should trigger an alert to the monitoring team via email. You as a Cloud Architect will need to understand the current architecture and determine, based on the AWS CloudWatch and AWS Config Manage Rules or conformance packages which options are available to configure a logging solution that meets customer requirements.

**NIST Requirement**

| Control ID |             Control Description              |
| ---------- | :------------------------------------------: |
| AC-6(9)    |  Log the execution of privileged functions.  |
| AU-2       |                Event Logging                 |
| AU-6(1)    | Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting |

**Customer Requirement**

| Control ID          |                                                                       Control Description                                                                       |
| ------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Voyager-ctrl-mon-01 | Systems must be appropriately monitored. Logs needs to be captured at the OS level and alerts will need to be triggered and sent to SOC team when root is used. |

**AWS resources review and conclusions**

By reviewing the following available resources, you will come to conclude what needs to be done to meet Voyagerâ€™s control requirements. See below the conclusions.

### Instructions

#### CloudWatch Logs introduction

Logs are an essential tool to gain visibility into what is happening in your instances. Besides Metrics, CloudWatch allows you to collect and search logs.

Before we dive into CloudWatch Logs, we need to understand the concepts of log stream and log groups .

A log stream is a sequence of log events coming from the same source (e.g., EC2 instance).

A log group is a group of log streams that shares the same retention, monitoring and access control settings. Used for logical grouping of the log streams. If EC2 instances are running the same application, we can group their log streams into one log group.

#### CloudWatch Logs analysis

Our EC2 instances generates many log files. The Linux operating system has its own log, and our application running on it can also generate their own logs.

These logs can be collected by the CloudWatch agent , an agent application that (optionally) runs in your EC2 instances.

CloudWatch agent is pre-installed and configured to collect the logs in all the EC2 instances for this part of the workshop.
