## Infrastructure Protection

### Introduction

**Time to complete**: 25 minutes

**Learning Objectives**:

- Understand how to configure patching for EC2 instances
- Create a mechanism to ensure that your instances are periodically updated.
- Implement reporting mechanism for patching compliance

### Exercise

#### Requirements Scenario

Voyager Security team has provided the controls and technical requirements to ensure that EC2 Linux instances are patched with only security updates regularly every Saturday after 10:00 pm automatically. Voyager does not have a current solution and is looking to adopt a cloud native approach that can be quickly implemented. Additionally, the Security team is asking for evidence that a detective mechanism is in place to ensure that this requirement is satisfied. You as a Cloud Architect will need to understand the current architecture and determine, based on the EC2 User Guide and AWS Config Manage Rules or conformance packages which options are available to configure a patching solution that meets customer requirements.

**NIST Requirement**

| Control ID |                                                             Control Description                                                              |
| ---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| SI-2c      | Install security-relevant software and firmware updates within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] of the release of the updates. |

**Customer Requirement**

| Control ID          |                         Control Description                          |
| ------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Voyager-ctrl-inf-03 | Instances must be patched with security updates weekly on Saturdays. |

**AWS resources review and conclusions**

By reviewing the following available resources, you will come to conclude what needs to be done to meet Voyagerâ€™s control requirements. See below the conclusions.

### Instructions

SSM agent has been installed and pre-configured for you. You are going to confirm that the EC2 instances in the environment are reporting to the SSM console. You need to configure SSM patch manager to run periodically during the pre-approved maintenance window. Configure AWS Config rule to report patching compliance.

Open the AWS Systems Manager console , in the left navigation pane, choose Patch Manager.

Choose Configure patching. In the Instances to patch section, choose Select Instances Manually: Select the check box next to the name of each managed node you want to patch.

In the Patching schedule section, choose:

Schedule in a new Maintenance Window and select a Maintenance Window schedule. Use a CRON schedule builder
Under Maintenance Window run frequency, change to Every Saturday at 12:00
Under Maintenance duration select 3
Under Maintenance window name write: NISTPatch or as desired
Under Patching Operation select Scan and install
Finally press configure patching
