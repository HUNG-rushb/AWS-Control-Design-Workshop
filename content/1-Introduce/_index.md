### Customer Scenario

Voyager is a global data, analytics, and technology company. It plays an essential role in the economy by helping companies in diverse industries make critical decisions with greater confidence. It helps businesses provide a seamless and positive experience during lifeâ€™s pivotal moments, like applying for a job or mortgage, financing education, or buying a car. Work with over 2.5B+ consumer credit card files and therefore are regulated by multiple entities. This year acquired through merging and acquisitions a company that specializes in preventing fraud risk and loss. This company that has recently merged with them is proprietary of an application named Fraud Risk and Loss application (FRL) that is running in AWS Cloud. Although the FRL app was initially built for minor demand now needs to address corporate control requirements based on NIST 800-53rev5 before releasing into production.

You were hired by Voyager as a Cloud Security Architect and your goal is to design and implement the necessary preventive and detective guardrails before it's launched as part of the organization's portfolio.

You have the opportunity to learn the process on how to address these issues while leveraging the AWS documentation and security services to design and implement.
